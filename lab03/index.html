            My first webpage! I am so happy to be back in college, This is HTML language 
            is really challenging and that's fine because im always 
            up for a challenge so its nothing. I have to be honest HTML is very intimidating.
            I know that i will finish this class and be a lot more knowledgeable than i have been 
            in the past, this Web Standard course is my 3rd class of Computer Science.

            <h2>What I've learned</h2>
            <p>
                1. I am honestly learning that i am not great at coding at all and that
                this class provides info about not only web standards but coding too,
                 which will probably be good for me.
                
                2. Last semester my instructor stressed that if we didnt thoroughly mastered the coding 
                class she taught that we would struggle in the next course and she was correct i am currently lost with everything 
                going on in my current Computer Science course.


                3. I am learning that once you get a great understanding of the
                 basics everything else will come easier.

            were wrong, i got this.
            I use Youtube a lot to gain a better understanding of things
