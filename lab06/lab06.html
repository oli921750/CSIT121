    <h3>What is the name of the website?</h3>
    <p>The name of the site I evaluated is called <strong>Sephora</strong>.</p>
   
    <h4>What is the site's target audience?</h4>
    <p>The website targets individuals interested in purchasing or becoming knowledgeable about cosmetics, as well as skin care, hair care, and perfumes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lotions</li>
        <li>Facial Masks</li>
        <li>Lip Scrubs</li>
        <li>Acne Treatments</li>
        <li>Shampoo</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h5>How is the site organized?</h5>
    <p>The site was created in a linear organization style.</p>
   
    <h6>What Crap Design principle does the website use?</h6>
    <p>The website uses all principles of Crap Design: contrast, repetition, size, shape, alignment, and proximity.</p>
   
    <h6>What is the audit score according to the accessibility checker?</h6>
    <p>The site scored 68 according to the accessibility checker, which was the lowest score of all the sites I tested.</p>
   
    <h6>What is the site's efficiency?</h6>
    <p>The site worked well; it loaded quickly, and navigating to sections of items was swift and seamless.</p>
   
    <h6>Can users perform tasks quickly?</h6>
    <p>Performing tasks is rather quick on this site, according to my experiences browsing websites.</p>
   
    <h6>How is engagement?</h6>
    <p>Engagement on the Sephora site was pleasant; navigating my way around the site was simple. I purposely misspelled "lotion" in the search tab, and I was directed to the lotion section despite the incorrect spelling.</p>
   
    <h6>Is the site pleasant to use?</h6>
    <p>The site is pleasant to use; there is even a search bar at the top of the website.</p>
   
    <h6>Is the site appropriate for its industry?</h6>
    <p>Yes, the site is quite perfect for its industry. I find the site to be extremely organized, with all categories displayed at the top.</p>
   
    <h6>Recommendations based on what I learned in this module:</h6>
    <p>I would recommend adding an audio option as an accessibility option for individuals with intellectual disabilities. I consider adding that particular feature as an accessibility recommendation because most individuals with intellectual disabilities find spelling to be difficult.</p>
