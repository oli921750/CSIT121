                1. I am honestly learning that I am not great at coding at all, and this class provides information not only about web standards but also coding, which will probably be good for me.

            <p>
                2. Last semester, my instructor stressed that if we didn’t thoroughly master the coding class she taught, we would struggle in the next course. She was correct—I am currently lost with everything going on in my current Computer Science course.

            <p>
                3. I am learning that once you get a great understanding of the basics, everything else will come easier.

            <p>
                I am ready for the ride. I am not giving up on getting my degree. I do all of this for my baby, who depends on me, and I want to prove everyone who counted me out wrong. I got this!

                I use YouTube a lot to gain a better understanding of things:

            <h2>Best Design Practices</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to web design, I’ve learned the importance of simplicity and accessibility. Ensuring that web pages are mobile-friendly is crucial since many users access the web via mobile devices. Additionally, using semantic HTML helps make pages more accessible and easier to maintain in the future. Consistency in layout and clear navigation are also key aspects that contribute to a positive user experience.
